Check the whole codebase and tell me what you have understood?

following the coding structure in this project, I need to make some changes for sick leave like 
if the user select "yes" for document, then, user will be shown to section to upload a 
picture, otherwise user doesnt have to submit any doc. 
medical document in the case of "sick leave" - I want something like a dropdown from where 
user will select "yes" or "no". Based on the user selection, the upload image section will be
 appeared. 
Now for uploading doc:
Option 1: Store files on Discord (Recommended - Easiest)

User uploads file in Discord
Bot saves file URL/message link to database
Free, no external storage needed

I want to follow these approach, change db if needed to.


so in the case of  "review_leave_requests" command, implement the feature from where admin will be able approve or decline employee's leave request.
